This led to the conclusion that the drug is ineffective, but also leaves uncertain between (at least) two competing models:</p><ul><li>Model-1: the drug has no effect whatsoever on any individual.</li><li>Model-2: the drug saves 10% of the population and kills the another 10%.<br>&ndash;></li><li>From a polcy maker viewpoint, the two models may be deemed equivalent, the drug has zero average effect on the target population.</li><li>From an individual viewpoint, the two models differ substaintially in the sets of risks and opportunities they offer:<ul><li>Model-1, the drug is useless but safe.</li><li>Model-2, the drug may be deemed dangerous by some and life-saver by others.<br>&ndash;> To see how such attitudes may emerge, assume that the drug also provides temporary pain relief</li><li>Model-1 would be deemed desirable and safe for all</li><li>Model-2 will scare away those who do noe urgently need the pain relief, while offering a glimpse of hope to those whose suffering has become unbearable, and who would be ready to risk death for the chance (10%) of recovery. (Hoping, of course, they are among the lucky beneficiaries.)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><p>The second theme of the paper &ndash; <strong>the crucial role of obervational studies</strong>.</p><ul><li>The above simple example show that supplementing the RCT with an observational study on the same population (conducted, for example, by an independent survey of patients who have the option of taking or avoiding the drug) would allow us to decide between the two models, totally changing our undrestanding of what risks await an individual taking the drug.</li><li>Consider an extreme case where the observational study shows 100% survival in both drug-chosing and drug-avoiding patients, as if patient knew in advance where danger lies and manaed to avoid it.<br>&ndash;> Such a finding immediately rules out Model-1 which claims no treatment effect on any individual.<br>The same argument applies when the probability of survival among option-having individuals is not precisely 100% but simply higher (or lower) tahn the probability of survival in the RCT. Using RCT alone, in the contrast, we were unable to rule out Model-1 or even to distinguish Model-1 from Model-2.</li><li>Consider another example/edge case wehre Model-2, rather than Model-1, is rule out as impossible. Assume the observational study informs us that all those who chose the drug died and all who avoided the drug survived. It seems that drug-choosers were truly dumb while drug-avoiders knew precisely what&rsquo;s good for them.<br>&ndash;> No one can be cured by the drug, contrary to Model-2.</li></ul></li><li><p>Summary: up to now, it is demonstrated how certain combinations of observational and experimental data can provide information on indiviudal behavior that each study alone cannot.</p></li><li><p>Next: we are ready to go to a more realistic motiviating example which</p><ul><li>establishes individual behavior for any combination of observational and experimental data, and, moreover,</li><li>demonstrate critical decision making ramifications of the information obtained.</li></ul></li></ul><h1 id=3-motivating-numerical-example>3.
